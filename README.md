# JoinLines [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/i08fuslw010ggweb?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/JamesASinclair/joinlines)

A Visual Studio extension that enables you to join lines in the text editor.

Either right-click in the editor and select 'Join Lines' or use the keyboard shortcut 'Alt+j'.

![Example of JoinLines in use](https://github.com/JamesASinclair/JoinLines/blob/master/example.gif "Example of JoinLines in use")

If you've not highlighted any text then the current line will have the next line appended to it. If you've selected a block of text then the whole lot will be joined into a single line

This code is heavily based on the [CodeMaid](https://github.com/codecadwallader/codemaid) extension by [Steve Cadwallader](https://github.com/codecadwallader)
